Many people took note of his exceptional behavior and wondered if he should have his own thread. So here we are, because this guy is nuttier than I thought.\n\nOn the surface Destiny might seem like any other Twitch streamer. There's nothing particularly noteworthy about his gameplay far as I can tell. What IS noteworthy are his debates with other people and how he acts during them. The guy is the definition of what some people call the Gish Gallop. He fires off tons of information at rapid speed to drown out his opponent. But when he gets on the ropes the guy chimps out like crazy.\n\nHis debate with Mister Metokur is probably the best example of his behavior. If you can even stomach the 'tism for very long you'll see what I mean about his debate style. At the very least I recommend you watch the bit at one hour and twenty seven minutes where he loses his shit at the idea that people can make decisions. Really.\n\n\n\n\n\nDestiny is also completely unable to take criticism. He constantly DMCAs clips showing how fucking stupid he is. This has most recently gotten him into a spat with Sargon of Akkad who had pulled some particularly ridiculous claims from the Jontron debate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also reports that an angry girlfriend got a hold of his Twitter account and posted pictures of his dick once. I haven't been able to find the pictures, but I did find that some of his fans posted their own dickpics in solidarity with him. Just lovely.\nhttps://archive.is/Ne9qK\n\nA leaked chatlog also shows that he was flirting with a fifteen year old girl and may have also fucked her. So there's that.\nEDIT: If what @FartingRetard says is to be believed it was just a picture of her in a bikini. Still creepy as fuck.\nhttps://archive.is/ssxNx\n\n\nHe also supports incest. I'm still trying to find the exact video, but there are clips of it at the beginning of the last video in this post. If anyone can find the original I'll add it to the OP.\n\nNaked Ape also just put out a video which highlights many of these examples of Destiny's behavior and more. (It was also easy for me to pillage archive links from.)\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsite: http://www.destiny.gg/\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/user/destiny\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OmniDestiny\nReddit Account: https://www.reddit.com/user/NeoDestiny\nSub-Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/",

For the love of God, if you have any particular sexual fetishes or anything like that, DON'T SHARE THEM WITH US.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\n\nI've been noticing a trend where people are being a little more...open about their preferences.\n\nGuys, it's cool that you feel comfortable enough to share things here, but on the whole try to keep it clean. If you wanna discuss your orientation and the like, cool, whatever helps you relate to each other, but  the things you find fap worthy do not need to be discussed. Not everyone likes to read that so be considerate. I don't think it will, but I'm gonna be watchdoggin' if it gets out of hand.",

It's:\n\n1) Respect one another and be civil.\n\nYou might not agree with everyone all the time, someone might rub you the wrong way, doesn't mean you need to be a dick about it. If they're bothering you, bring it up to a mod or admin. \n\nDon't call people names, don't libel people, that sort of shit. It's common sense really but I think I should spell it out. I think I also need to spell it out here because we sometimes attract would be trolls. This isn't 4chan or /cwc/, I won't tolerate people calling other people \"fags\" or other shit that might fly on a board like /b/. \n\n2) Save the drama for your mama\n\nDon't start drama and shit on here, we don't need it. If you get personally involved with another forum, and shit is happening between you and them, don't bring it onto the forum. We should all be adults here, we don't need childish shit like that going on.\n\nThat's about all I can think of for now and if I come up with other universal rules, I will update this thread.",

You guys are a constant source of intellectual amusement, with each of you coming to every conversation with a unique point of view and theory. It's for that reason I've volunteered to support the forum with an true and honest domain name and an actual host that isn't going to trash our happy home just because of whom it is centered around.\n\nHere's what the change means:\n\nThe forums are now running on a pure form of the PHPBB3 software suite, so I can change anything. I'm a programmer by employment and by hobby, so anything we may need tweaked or installed to suit our needs can be done.\nDreamhost is now the provider of hosting services, and they will not chop down our Internet unless we violate International or United States law.\nAll settings, users, and posts in the previous forum(s) have been lost forever. Sorry.\n\nChampthom is the Super Administrator and the Community Manager. He has complete control over the content of the forum and its users. I've given him the task of setting up the boards and promoting the right people into Administrative and Moderator roles, and also ensuring that Hulk Hogan be given his proper yellow title (as he is a True American).\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tchampthom said:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tFor the record, anyone who was banned that I remember WILL be banned on sight here.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\n\n\nI've said my piece and I will be stepping back from this point. I do not wish to become the Supreme Glorious Leader of the board and its users, and I'd like to see the current administration continue on in their role. I will not be participating in community management, merely maintaining the boards and making sure that everyone gets a chance to discuss Chris without worry of another shut down. I like you guys, and I want to see this group carry on for a long time.\n\nFeel free to use this thread to celebrate, make software requests, or do whatever.",

There is also a scene where a Blue Meanie questions some disguised Beatles, asking, \"Are you Bluish? You don't look Bluish...\" Sounds like \"You don't look Jewish.\"\n\t\t\nClick to expand...",

You guys are a constant source of intellectual amusement, with each of you coming to every conversation with a unique point of view and theory. It's for that reason I've volunteered to support the forum with an true and honest domain name and an actual host that isn't going to trash our happy home just because of whom it is centered around.\n\nHere's what the change means:\n\nThe forums are now running on a pure form of the PHPBB3 software suite, so I can change anything. I'm a programmer by employment and by hobby, so anything we may need tweaked or installed to suit our needs can be done.\nDreamhost is now the provider of hosting services, and they will not chop down our Internet unless we violate International or United States law.\nAll settings, users, and posts in the previous forum(s) have been lost forever. Sorry.\n\nChampthom is the Super Administrator and the Community Manager. He has complete control over the content of the forum and its users. I've given him the task of setting up the boards and promoting the right people into Administrative and Moderator roles, and also ensuring that Hulk Hogan be given his proper yellow title (as he is a True American).\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tchampthom said:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tFor the record, anyone who was banned that I remember WILL be banned on sight here.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\n\n\nI've said my piece and I will be stepping back from this point. I do not wish to become the Supreme Glorious Leader of the board and its users, and I'd like to see the current administration continue on in their role. I will not be participating in community management, merely maintaining the boards and making sure that everyone gets a chance to discuss Chris without worry of another shut down. I like you guys, and I want to see this group carry on for a long time.\n\nFeel free to use this thread to celebrate, make software requests, or do whatever.",

You guys are a constant source of intellectual amusement, with each of you coming to every conversation with a unique point of view and theory. It's for that reason I've volunteered to support the forum with an true and honest domain name and an actual host that isn't going to trash our happy home just because of whom it is centered around.\n\nHere's what the change means:\n\nThe forums are now running on a pure form of the PHPBB3 software suite, so I can change anything. I'm a programmer by employment and by hobby, so anything we may need tweaked or installed to suit our needs can be done.\nDreamhost is now the provider of hosting services, and they will not chop down our Internet unless we violate International or United States law.\nAll settings, users, and posts in the previous forum(s) have been lost forever. Sorry.\n\nChampthom is the Super Administrator and the Community Manager. He has complete control over the content of the forum and its users. I've given him the task of setting up the boards and promoting the right people into Administrative and Moderator roles, and also ensuring that Hulk Hogan be given his proper yellow title (as he is a True American).\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tchampthom said:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tFor the record, anyone who was banned that I remember WILL be banned on sight here.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\n\n\nI've said my piece and I will be stepping back from this point. I do not wish to become the Supreme Glorious Leader of the board and its users, and I'd like to see the current administration continue on in their role. I will not be participating in community management, merely maintaining the boards and making sure that everyone gets a chance to discuss Chris without worry of another shut down. I like you guys, and I want to see this group carry on for a long time.\n\nFeel free to use this thread to celebrate, make software requests, or do whatever.",

Many people took note of his exceptional behavior and wondered if he should have his own thread. So here we are, because this guy is nuttier than I thought.\n\nOn the surface Destiny might seem like any other Twitch streamer. There's nothing particularly noteworthy about his gameplay far as I can tell. What IS noteworthy are his debates with other people and how he acts during them. The guy is the definition of what some people call the Gish Gallop. He fires off tons of information at rapid speed to drown out his opponent. But when he gets on the ropes the guy chimps out like crazy.\n\nHis debate with Mister Metokur is probably the best example of his behavior. If you can even stomach the 'tism for very long you'll see what I mean about his debate style. At the very least I recommend you watch the bit at one hour and twenty seven minutes where he loses his shit at the idea that people can make decisions. Really.\n\n\n\n\n\nDestiny is also completely unable to take criticism. He constantly DMCAs clips showing how fucking stupid he is. This has most recently gotten him into a spat with Sargon of Akkad who had pulled some particularly ridiculous claims from the Jontron debate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also reports that an angry girlfriend got a hold of his Twitter account and posted pictures of his dick once. I haven't been able to find the pictures, but I did find that some of his fans posted their own dickpics in solidarity with him. Just lovely.\nhttps://archive.is/Ne9qK\n\nA leaked chatlog also shows that he was flirting with a fifteen year old girl and may have also fucked her. So there's that.\nEDIT: If what @FartingRetard says is to be believed it was just a picture of her in a bikini. Still creepy as fuck.\nhttps://archive.is/ssxNx\n\n\nHe also supports incest. I'm still trying to find the exact video, but there are clips of it at the beginning of the last video in this post. If anyone can find the original I'll add it to the OP.\n\nNaked Ape also just put out a video which highlights many of these examples of Destiny's behavior and more. (It was also easy for me to pillage archive links from.)\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsite: http://www.destiny.gg/\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/user/destiny\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OmniDestiny\nReddit Account: https://www.reddit.com/user/NeoDestiny\nSub-Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/",

If you can even stomach the 'tism for very long you'll see what I mean about his debate style. At the very least I recommend you watch the bit at one hour and twenty seven minutes where he loses his shit at the idea that people can make decisions. Really.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nAs someone who's worked plenty of shitty jobs the one thing I can't stand is when people try to tell me how to improve my life.  Doesn't this fucking idiot understand that you need lower level/entry level jobs in order to function in any business?  Sure the CEO makes a shit ton of money but someone still has to deliver that mail.  Idiots that think everyone can be on the same tier need a nice bitchslap.  As sad as it sounds there's gotta be Gods and Clods in order for shit to work.  Someones gotta pick those tomatoes.  Someones gotta shovel that shit.  It's wanting to rise above those jobs that helps define what you want out of life.",
